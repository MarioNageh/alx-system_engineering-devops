ALX Project Web infrastructure design
Task 2. Definitions and Explanations
•
For every additional element, why you are adding it
we have added three new components; a firewall for each server to protect them from
being attacked and exploited, 1 SSL certificate to server www.foobar.com over HTTPS
and three monitoring clients that will collect logs and send them to our data collector
Sumologic.
•
•
What are firewalls for
Monitoring and controlling incoming/outgoing network traffic.
Filtering data based on predefined security rules.
Preventing unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.
Enhancing network security and protecting sensitive information.
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
Encrypt data during transmission, safeguarding it from eavesdropping.
Ensure data integrity, preventing tampering during transit.
Verify the authenticity of the website, preventing phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
Enhance user trust and privacy by securing sensitive information like passwords and
payment details.
•
What monitoring is used for
Keep track of system performance, health, and availability.
Detect and resolve issues before they impact users.
Optimize resource usage and ensure efficient operations.
Provide insights for decision-making and future planning.
Enhance security by identifying and responding to anomalies.
Maintain high-quality user experiences and service reliability.
• How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring tools collect data through agents, log files, APIs, network analysis, and more.
This data is processed, analyzed, and presented in user-friendly formats to track system
performance, identify issues, and make informed decisions.
• Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
By using monitoring software or tool collect web server QOS and analyst it
what the issues
A. Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Here's why it can be problematic
Loss of End-to-End Encryption
Data Privacy ConcernsIncreased Attack Surface
Certificate Management Complexity
•Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Because once it is down it means data can be added or updated meaning some features of
the application won’t work.
•Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and
application server) might be a problem
Having servers with identical components can lead to resource waste, scalability issues,
maintenance complexity, and inefficient performance due to lack of specialization. It can
hinder optimal resource allocation and flexibility for growth.
