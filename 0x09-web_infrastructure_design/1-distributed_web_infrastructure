ALX Project Web infrastructure design
Task 1. Definitions and Explanations
For every additional element, why are adding it
Adding a new server so that we can be able to add a load balancer to handle too much incoming
traffic and enable us to eliminate a single point of failure which could occur by having just one
server.
•What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it
works
Our load balancer employs the Round Robin algorithm, which establishes connections in
a sequential manner, unless a server is inaccessible. Incoming requests are distributed
among servers in a rotational order, processing each request in sequence. Once all servers
have received a request, the cycle begins anew from the first server. This algorithm is
chosen when servers possess equal specifications and persistent connections are not
extensively utilized.
•Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the
difference between both
We utilize an Active-Active setup for our load balancers. In this configuration, both load
balancers are always actively operational. This approach ensures availability and
redundancy. If one load balancer experiences an issue, the other can seamlessly take over
the workload, ensuring uninterrupted service.

On the other hand, an Active-Passive setup involves having one server active while the
other remains in a passive state. The passive server comes into action only when the active
server fails. It acts as a standby, activated as needed to maintain service continuity.
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
The primary (master) database server handles writing operations and manages data
modifications.
Replicas (slave) database servers are copies of the primary and are used mainly for read
operations.
Replicas receive updates from the primary transaction log and keep their data
synchronized.
What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to
the application
The Primary node handles write operations and is the authoritative source for data
changes. Applications interact with the Primary for data modification queries (e.g.,
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). It ensures data integrity and manages transactions.
The Replica node is primarily used for read operations. Applications can query the Replica
for data retrieval (e.g., SELECT queries). Replicas receive updates from the Primary's
transaction log and provide improved read scalability and redundancy.what the issues
•
Where are SPOF
DNS Server Failure
Web Server (Nginx) Failure
Application Server (App Server) Failure
Database Server (MySQL) Failure
•
•
Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
No Firewall: Allows potential denial of service attacks, breaches through unsecured ports,
and data exfiltration.
No HTTPS: Exposes sensitive data due to unencrypted communication, putting passwords
and information at risk.
No
monitoring
Inability to identify and respond to system issues promptly.
Missed opportunities for performance optimization and issue prevention.
Reduced visibility into system health and anomalies.
